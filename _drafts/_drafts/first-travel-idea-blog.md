## What going on Bart?

Well I guess most of you know, but not everyone so here it goes..

In July and August 2024 I've been traveling. In May 2024 I've bought a rather big 4x4 car (Mitsubishi Montero) that already had a rooftop tent. In the month after I've worked on getting a fridge on the right spot on and get the kitchen gear in the right spot so I'd be able to live from the car for the time.

After work I drove home, through my bag in the corner, took a shower, stuffed the last times in the car and on saturday I drove to to friends where I stayed the night and sunday I continued to drive past Hamburg where I've booked the 23.55 to Norway!

The trip through Norway was amazing, I've met so many people, and had a unplanned venture since the alternator of the car brake. After getting to Cape North and hiking there I've travel to the three country point between Norway, Finland and Russia to continue on my way down and booking the boat to Iceland with just three days the get there and not even sure if the shipping company would accept my ID card, the website only allowed Passport selection but in the end nobody cared about it.

In Iceland I've traveled for about three and a a halve weeks and enjoyed it a lot! Traveled the F-roads wich are made for 4x4

Well I've been a bit restless ever since my two month travel to both Cape North and Iceland.
