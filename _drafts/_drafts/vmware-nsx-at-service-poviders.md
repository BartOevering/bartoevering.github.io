*[VCD]: VMware Cloud Director

Past year I've been bussy with VMware Cloud Director (VCD) and in new versions some awsome collaberations with VMware NSX have been made and I want to take you aloing in that!

## VMware Cloud Director
Often when I talk to people in the field they've heard of the name VMWare Cloud Director (VCD) but they are missing what it's exaclty used for and where to align the product within their envirnment. So to start off I searched on the VMware docs about the explaination they are using but actully it leaves me with more questions that anwsers.

> At its core, __VMware Cloud Director transforms physical resources__, such as network, storage, and compute, within a data center __into flexible Provider Virtual Data Centers (PVDC)__. __Cloud Services Providers__ have the capability to __allocate or share resources__ from a PVDC to multiple Organization VDCs (Org VDCs), allowing for __differentiated service levels__ for various customers and customer units.
