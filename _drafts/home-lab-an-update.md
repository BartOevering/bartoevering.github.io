Almost a year in the running, my third version of running a (not) so home lab. Any conlcusions?

## Recap

Let's start with a quick recap. I know I've sadly not writen that much in the past year. This is because work lead me down an amazing rollercoster and stuff is chaning. It simpley costed my time to adapt and I'm now at a point where there are some brain cycles available to start thinking about writing new blogs.

So since November 24th 2023 I've placed version three in the racks and actually on December the 3rd 2023 I've powered off the old R720's. The whole migration of VMs took under a day of work since I actually migrated all VMs in the second weekend. During the week I mainly did some test and senaty checks to see that everything was working in the racks the same way as I've build it.

Want to know more about the exact hardware and considirations in this third verion? Then it's better to read this blog: ["Home lab, again an new version"]({% post_url 2023-10-25-home-lab-version-three %})

## Stuff that went wrong
Well actually there is not too much to write here. I've been offline for an extend period of time and actually, I've not once logged into the envoirmnet. Also I've had no complaints from people using the envoirment in the meanwhile that something wasn't working right. Also, I've been able to install updates for vCenter and ESXi without any downtime and the whole envoirment has been extreemly stable for the past year
