I’m Bart Oevering an Infrastructure Consultant working for [Conscia](https://www.conscia.com/nl/). I’ve been working at Conscia since September 2018 and what a trip it already has been! I had a massive learning curve for the VMware products since, up till that point, I didn’t work with any of the VMware products yet. During my studies (intermediate vocational education and university of applied science), I got certified in Citrix XenApp 5.5 and Citrix XenServer 5 but in VMware? No, I didn’t do anything with VMware so I was up for a treat- more about that in future blogs. In 2025 I've decided to started to use VirtuWise as a brand and place any professional work under there, including this blog.

In 2007 I started my intermediate vocational education at the Deltion College in Zwolle. There I followed the study ‘Systemadministrator’ or ‘Systeembeheerder’ in Dutch. The Deltion College invited me to join the SkillMasters competition organized by ECABO and I managed to get second place in the preliminary rounds for North/North-East Holland. In 2014 I started with the study ‘System and Network Engineering’ at the Hogeschool Utrecht. I really enjoyed my time there and I was fortunate to have a highly motivated study group. By 2018 I graduated with an average grade of 7.8 (4.0 GPA). After I finished my studies I decided to start looking for a job. I had a short search and decided to go for RedLogic because the atmosphere in the team felt really nice and the projects that I would work on sounded even better.

## What am I doing when I’m not working?
![Climbing Yosemite](/assets/img/climbing_at_yosemite.jpg){: w="250px" .right }
When I’m not busy with something work-related I love to go out on an adventure. For a couple of years now, I really love to go climbing. Hopefully future outside climbing will go better than last time when I fractured a bone in my foot. Since March 2020 I had more time, as I didn’t need to travel to work anymore, and I discovered that I also enjoy other sports like walking, running, or biking. During the summer holidays, I also enjoyed walking/hiking and I've discovered the art of traveling the road less travel. I've bought an SUV with a rooftop tent and enjoyed a two month travel to the tip of Norway and Iceland in 2024.

Besides the physical activities, I love to write the occasional blurt of text in my own blog. In these blogs, I will share some technical knowledge and also store some thoughts/ideas. I’m currently running two physical servers ([check out this post]({% post_url 2021-01-15-new-hardware %})) in the datacentre and enjoy building configurations or scripts that help me in my day-to-day life. This blog will not only be about VMware but could also be about VyOS and upcoming certifications or topics like home automation but maybe also about me traveling?

## My certifications
Since I’m working for Conscia I’ve obtained a lot of additional knowledge. Here are the certifications that I managed to pass so far (last updated: 05-2025):
